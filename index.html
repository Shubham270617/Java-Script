    <!-- 
    JavaScript is a scripting language used for client-side and server-side scripting. and also a dynamic language
    JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language.
    JavaScript allows you to create interactive web pages.
    JavaScript is easy to learn and use. we don't need to tell what data to store in the javascript. 

    
    1. varaible in JS
    (Variable are containers for data )
    If i have to print the value of a variable then we will not write the variable into double quote. we directly write the name of the variable.
     = assignment operatora=b means the vale of b is store in a
    boolean variable: true and false
    
    1. Variable names are case sensitive: "a" and "A is different"
    2. Only letter, digits, ubnderscore(_) and $ is allowed.(not even space)
    3. Only a letter, underscore(_) or $ should be 1st character. (No numeric valeue is allowed before the variable name is defined)
    4. Reserved words cannot be variable names.
    we must have to use keyword infront of variable names.
if any variable is declared in the javascript but no value is assigned to it then we will say that the  variable is not defined.
    let, const and var 
    1. var = varaible can be re-declared and updated. A global scope variable.
    2. let = variable can be re-declared but not updated. A block scope variable.
    3. const = variable can not be re-declared and updated. A block scope variable.


let can be changed , const cannot be changed, but const object keys can be changed. 



    **Data Types in JavaScript
1. Primitive (7) and non primitive types : Number String Boolean Undefined Null BigInteger Symbol.
Null means absence of an object////// Object: It is a collection of values.
we can change the constant object keys can be changed.
    

Chapter 2 Operators and conditional Statements
 
used to perform some operation on data: 
1. +, -, *,/ (Arithmatic opertor) , Modulus operator %, Exponent operator (**) , increment (++), decrement (--)
2. =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, **= (Assignment opertor) it will assigne the value.
3. ==, ===(it check the datatype),!=,!== (Comparison opertor) , >,>=,<,<=
4. when a number is put in the string it will first convert into a number and then compare it with other number.
5 &&(logical AND) ||(Logical OR) !(Logical Not) logical operator 


Conditional Statements: To implement some condition in the code 
1. If Statement
2. if-else Statement  // Syntax
3.else if statement is
4. Ternary Operators" condition? true : false output
  

Chapter 3 Loops and String:

1. Loops: Are used to execute a piece of code again and again.
(a) for loop : for(let i = 1; i<=5; i++) written as initilize, stopping condition, updation 
(b) Infinite loop A loop that never ends.
(c) while loop : while(condition) {//do some work}
(d) do while loop : do {//do some work} while (condition)
(e) for of loop (it helps to put on strings and arrays) and for in loop (used for object): 

Java Script strings are mutable.
Strings: it is a sequence of charcater used to represent text
(a) Create String: let str = "Gaming Websites"
(b) String Length : str.length
(c) String Indices: str[0], str[1], str[2] always start thye position with 0


Template Literals in JS: A way to have embedded expressions in strings 'this is a template literals'
string Interpolation : TO create strings by doing substitution of placeholders 
 'string text ${expression} string text' \n remanides us about that it will print the statemnet in the next lines

String Methods in JS: //// immutable cannot be changed 
These are built in function to manipulate  a string // it means the block of code that will help to let us work.
1. str.toUpperCase(); 2. str.toLowerCase(); 3.str.trim() //removes whitespaces. 4. str.slice(start, end); retuen part of string. 5. str1.concat(str2) //joins str2 with str1
6. str.replace(searchVal,newVal) 7. str.charAt(idx)


// Arrays is itself an object types. //mutable that can be changed. 
collection of items:
let heroes = ["ironman", "hulk", "thor", "batman"];
let marks = [96,75,85,66,83];
let info = ["ranhul","86", "Delhi"]

Array Indices in : arr[0], arr[1], arr[2]

looping over an Array : Print all elemnets of an array

Arrays Methods:
1. Push(): add to end
2. Pop(): delete from end and return
3. toString(): converts array to string
4. concat, shift and unshift (add in the start)
5. splice(): add or remove elements from array
6. slice(): create a new array

// Functions: Blocks of code that perform a specific task, can be invoked whenever needed.
how the function is formed 
1. Function Defination:             
function functionName(){//do some work}
2. Function Call:
functionName(); NaN not an number
** FUnctiion paramenetes are local variables of function and it hs block scope it means it servive onllt til the function parameters 

1. Arrow Functions: Compact way of writing a function 
const functionName(param1, param2) =>{//do some work}

forEach Loop in Arrays //higher order function or methods ==> it means that it take other function as parameter or returnany function.
arr.forEach(callBackfunction)
CallBackFunction: Here, it is a functionto execute for each elemnet in the array
A callback is a function passed as an argument to the another function. With this we can pass three parameters (val,indx,arr) 

2. Map Method in JS : Create a new array with the results of some operations. The calue its callback returns are used to form new array //similar to forEach
arr.map(callbackFnx(value,index,array))

3. filter Function Create a new array of elemnts that give true  for a condition/filter.
eg: all even elemnts let newArr = arr.filter((val) =>{return val% 2 === 0})
