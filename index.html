    JavaScript is a scripting language used for client-side and server-side scripting. and also a dynamic language
    JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language.
    JavaScript allows you to create interactive web pages.
    JavaScript is easy to learn and use. we don't need to tell what data to store in the javascript. 

    
    1. varaible in JS
    (Variable are containers for data )
    If i have to print the value of a variable then we will not write the variable into double quote. we directly write the name of the variable.
     = assignment operatora=b means the vale of b is store in a
    boolean variable: true and false
    
    1. Variable names are case sensitive: "a" and "A is different"
    2. Only letter, digits, ubnderscore(_) and $ is allowed.(not even space)
    3. Only a letter, underscore(_) or $ should be 1st character. (No numeric valeue is allowed before the variable name is defined)
    4. Reserved words cannot be variable names.
    we must have to use keyword infront of variable names.
if any variable is declared in the javascript but no value is assigned to it then we will say that the  variable is not defined.
    let, const and var 
    1. var = varaible can be re-declared and updated. A global scope variable.
    2. let = variable can be re-declared but not updated. A block scope variable.
    3. const = variable can not be re-declared and updated. A block scope variable.


let can be changed , const cannot be changed, but const object keys can be changed. 



    **Data Types in JavaScript
1. Primitive (7) and non primitive types : Number String Boolean Undefined Null BigInteger Symbol.
Null means absence of an object////// Object: It is a collection of values.
we can change the constant object keys can be changed.
